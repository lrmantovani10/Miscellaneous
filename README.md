* Arduino - an Arduino program for a self-driving robot that aims to finish a maze. It rotates around an axis and detects distances from objects based on a sonar radar and moves to the place where no objects are found. By doing this repeatedly (and adjusting for rotation angle according to the hardware utilized and the terrain at hand), the robot is able to successfully exit the maze.
